            Each round, you will have 5 attempts to guess the person's name correctly.

            After each incorrect guess, you will receive a helpful hint!

            For each person you are able to guess correctly, you win that round and 1 point will be added to your score!

            If you run out of guesses, you lose that round and the answer will be provided. Your score will be deducted by 1 point.
